The output was always a sequential alternation of the max elements from left to right digit. So, firstly sort the array and then, 
sequentially assign the digit num from the decending order list to the two number.

Time Complexity: O(nlog n)
Merge Sort - O(nlog n)
Assigment - O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)
New list created during and after sorting
