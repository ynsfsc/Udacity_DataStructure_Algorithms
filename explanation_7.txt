Same as problem 5 with small differences;
Path splitted around the '/' character;
Not Found Handler added.

n - sub-path num of input path

Add Handler Method
Time Complexity: O(n) - trie insert method - each sub-path of the path needs to be iterated through
Space Complexity: O(n) - create a trie node for each sub-path

Lookup Method
Time Complexity: O(n) - trie find method - iterate each sub-path of the path
Space Complexity: O(1) - no additional memory allocated
